Inclusion Criteria:
  -  Eligible patients are those over 18 years of age who are regularly scheduled to undergo a right hemicolectomy via a minimally invasive approach (robotic or laparoscopic) with the creation of an anastomosis. Right colectomy will be defined as removal of the ascending colon, ligation of the ileocolic artery and vein, +/- removal of the terminal ileum, +/- removal of the proximal transverse colon, and +/- removal of the right branch of the middle colic artery and vein.
Exclusion Criteria:
  -  Pregnant women
  -  Additional colon resection is planned (i.e. left colectomy or proctectomy)
  -  Vulnerable populations such as prisoners or adults unable to give consent
  -  If the scheduled surgery is planned at Butterworth hospital (as to standardize the nursing care received postoperatively)
  -  Emergent cases
Patients will be excluded from the study intra-operatively if:
  -  The procedure is converted to an open resection
  -  If a loop ileostomy is performed in addition to the right colectomy
