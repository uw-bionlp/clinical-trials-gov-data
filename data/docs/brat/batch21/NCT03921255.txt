Inclusion Criteria:
  -  UWM undergraduates who were at least 18 years old who (i) score of at least 1 [A Little (Distressed or Bothered)] on the OCI-R obsessing subscale, and (ii) at least one TAFS item scored 3 (Agree) or 4 (Agree Strongly) were be eligible to participate in the study. A score of 1 or higher on the obsessing subscale of the OCI-R indicates the presence of obsessional intrusions, and was used as a cutoff in previous research (Siwiec et al., 2017). A score of 3 or above on an item of the TAFS indicates the participant agrees with and holds some pronounced TAF bias.
Exclusion Criteria:
  -  Individuals whose primary language is not English will not be included in the study. Assessment and training programs are all written in English (we are not able to present a version in another language) - it is important for participants to understand subtlety of slightly varying vignettes in the training program.
