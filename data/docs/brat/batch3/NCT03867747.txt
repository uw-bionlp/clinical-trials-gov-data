Inclusion Criteria:
  -  Patients with structural heart disease and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
  -  Age > 18 years
  -  either
       1. Recurring symptomatic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that requires ICD intervention (e.g. shock or anti-tachycardia stimulation). At least 3 episodes within the 3 months prior to inclusion or
       2. induction of symptomatic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that requires ICD intervention (e.g. shock or anti-tachycardia stimulation). Induction triggered by ICD or during electrophysiology studies (EPS) or both, a) and b)
  -  Refractory to antiarrhythmic combination therapy
  -  Beside the cardiac conditions: No competing illness that would additionally limit the life expectancy to less than 6 months
  -  No prior radiation therapy in the thorax area
  -  No pregnancy and no active breastfeeding
  -  Ability to consent and consent to study participation
Exclusion Criteria:
  -  ICD electrode malfunction of ICD readings outside reference range
  -  Lack of evidence of a myocardial scar (Computer tomography or magnetic resonance tomography for MRI-capable ICD aggregates or electrophysiological measurement)
  -  No possible induction of symptomatic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia non-persistent or persistent with delivery of ICD therapies such as antitachycardic pacing or shock
  -  Contraindication to radiosurgery (e.g. precise target volume definition not possible due to image artifacts created from a left ventricular assist device [LVAD])
  -  Inability to consent or missing or withdrawn consent
